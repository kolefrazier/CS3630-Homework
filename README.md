My homework repository for CS3630 - Client Side Frameworks, Fall 2017.

HTML, based in a barebones ASP.NET Core project, as I have grown accustomed to Visual Studio 2017's ASP.NET Core developer workspace over other popular IDEs I have used in the past. 
(I like having Intellisense working with Bootstrap and JavaScript!)

Whwere this class is focused on JavaScript, the vast majority of homework files are found in the wwwroot folder.

My homework repository for CS3630 - Client Side Frameworks, Fall 2017.

Assignments are basic HTML and JS files, wrapped in a barebones ASP.NET Core project. I did this so I could use Visual Studio 2017 and the Intellisense pleasantries I have grown accustomed to recently. Debugging is done outside of VS, in Chrome or Firefox.

(Plus, I like Visual Studio 2017's ASP.NET Core developer workspace over other popular IDEs I have used in the past.)

Where this class is focused on JavaScript, all of the homework files are found in the wwwroot folder, in the appropriate assignment page. Viewing the live versions can be done by manually opening the files or running the solution (the /Home/Index page contains links to the assignment pages).
